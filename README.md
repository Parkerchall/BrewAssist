# BrewAssist
### Description
BrewAssist will be an app that helps you with one of the more challenging things to do in Minecraft, brewing. When playing minecraft there are many situations where potions come in handy, but you never know how to brew them. This app will change all of that, BrewAssist is going to be a one stop shop when it comes to potions. It's going to be able to tell you where to get the items for brewing, how to brew the potions, and the best way to use all the potions.

## SWOT Analysis
#### Strength
One of  strengths has always been styling, not just in coding. I'm an artist by heart and i'm hoping that reflects itself well in my project
#### Weakness
I definitely have not learned all of the material easily in class. I'm hoping that this project is a way for me to solidify all of the knowledge we have been given
#### Opportunities
I'm grateful that I have this week to nail down the material we have learned and I'm excited to be able to learn even more material throughout this week to make this project awesome
#### Threats
I am for sure more stressed out about this project more than the last. I feel as if i need to prove that i can do this not only to the teachers but also to myself.
