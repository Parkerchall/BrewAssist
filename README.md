# BrewAssist
### Description
BrewAssist will be an app that helps you with one of the more challenging things to do in Minecraft, brewing. When playing minecraft there are many situations where potions come in handy, but you never know how to brew them. This app will change all of that, BrewAssist is going to be a one stop shop when it comes to potions. It's going to be able to tell you where to get the items for brewing, how to brew the potions, and the best way to use all the potions.

### MVP
The MVP for this project is to have a website that is able to pull from an API to be able to show how to brew a potion based on user input. The user input will be a searchbar that is able to search for potions and come up with a recipe for crafting. There will also be a list of comments that users will be able to get and post to. There will be 3 Reference tabs on the top. The functionality of the tabs will be to get to navigate to the comments, potion search bar, and my post mvp which is going to be an enchanting search bar It will also have a feature for people to post images and comments of anything cool they've done in minecraft!
### Post MVP
After I accomplish my post MVP my goal is to be able to be able to improve the user input, I want to be able to add more functionality to the website and hopefully include a section for enchanting items. The way I plan on accomplishing this is by adding enchanting items to the same API on a different table, and then creating a new section of the app with a search bar that allows you to search weapons and list the possible enchantments and uses of those enchantments.

## SWOT Analysis
#### Strength
One of  strengths has always been styling, not just in coding. I'm an artist by heart and i'm hoping that reflects itself well in my project
#### Weakness
I definitely have not learned all of the material easily in class. I'm hoping that this project is a way for me to solidify all of the knowledge we have been given
#### Opportunities
I'm grateful that I have this week to nail down the material we have learned and I'm excited to be able to learn even more material throughout this week to make this project awesome
#### Threats
I am for sure more stressed out about this project more than the last. I feel as if i need to prove that i can do this not only to the teachers but also to myself.
